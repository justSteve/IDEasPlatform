note that my gh user name is justSteve for future reference. You can assume read rights to everything in that namespace. When working on any individual app you have write rights to the repo that backs the app. The local repos that synch to that namespace must be stored in the c:\myStuff\[app]. You can assume write rights on a per app basis.
